<h3><font color=white>9447 Exam</h3></font>
<pre>

Notes:

IF YOU CANT SUBMIT YOUR WEB RESULT, BASE64 ENCODE IT. SOMETHING AT UNSW IS BLOCKING YOUR REQUEST. HERE'S AN ENCODER THAT WORKS:</pre>

<pre>
The reverse engineering link is accidentally "howtohaq.com" instead of "how2haq.com". Change it yourself.

Also, sometimes the reverse engineering images don't work/look all messed up. This is because your browser doesn't know how big it is. The reaosn for this is that there's a whole bunch of ways a window manager can tell an application it's size has changed, and 1) the window manager writers think they should only have to send any one of the ways and 2) the browesr writers think they should only have to deal with one of the ways. TLDR linux sucks, rezsize your browser a few times and hit F5.

The include components in the eplxoit section ie. #include stdio.h are hidden in html becuase we didn't escape the angle brackets. Um. View the page source :-)

You need to log into the SSH system and port forward to access the web exam. ssh -L! Capital L sorry :-(

Welcome friends! How are you? I'm good, thanks for asking. So. This exam is made up for 3 sections. You will be marked out of your top 2 of the 3 sections, so feel free to totally ignore one section.

You'll notice the 3 questions on your profile. Each has specific information on them. Submission of answers is the same as it was for home work. There is an extra 5 minutes on top of the allotted time for you so submit, so if you're late then you're not going to get much sympathy unless you're having a problem with the site and have alerted staff about it. If this happens, email your solutions to thouth@gmail.com and brendan.hopper@gmail.com with the subject "2014 9447 exam".

When submitting your answers, please make a bit of effort with setting them out. Headings, paragraphs, whatever makes them more readable. This makes it easier for us and makes us more likely to give you marks as we won't hate your answer.

In order to access the web and reverse engineering challenges, use SSH local port forwarding. For example, run the command <br><i>ssh -L 8181:127.0.0.1:80 student@ip</i><br>and this will bind port 8181 on your local system with port 80 on the web servers local interface. Then you can point a web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8181 to access the exam.


Please make sure that your CSE username and Micro Corruption ID in http://how2haq.com/9447/settings is correct.

You're free to use the internet/books/your own computer (though if you're doing the web section, I recommend sticking to a mainstream browser like chrome/firefox/safari). You are _not_ allowed to communicate with any other person during the exam. There is a zero tolerance policy on this. If we see you with an IRC window open, gtalk, chatting to ur .us haqr buddiez on AIM, facebooking how much you hate this course, two netcat connections to each other, whatever, you're out and you fail the course. We've caught people colluding in the exam before and they failed straight out. They appealed all the way to Morri for a redo and we said no.

Just. Don't.

With that all said, good luck!
